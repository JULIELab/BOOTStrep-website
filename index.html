<h2>BOOTStrep</h2>
<p>
BOOTStrep (Bootstrapping Of Ontologies and Terminologies STrategic REsearch Project) is funded in the EC&acute;s 6th Framework Programme. The project will pull together already existing biological fact databases as well as various terminological repositories and implement a text analysis system which continuously increases their coverage by analysing biological documents.
</p>
<h3><a id="Impact"></a> Impact </h3>
<p>
Biological knowledge, up until now, is scattered in heterogeneous database formats and locked in unstructured natural language documents. The intended integration of biological knowledge in a homogeneous conceptual framework will ease access to this fragmented knowledge and substantially increase its usability for R &amp; D purposes, e.g., in the European bio-tech and pharmaceutical industry.
</p>
<h3><a id="BOOTStrep's_main_innovations"></a> BOOTStrep’s main innovations </h3>
<p>
Knowledge integration and reuse in the biology domain are the main goals of the BOOTStrep project. The resources and text mining tools developed within the project are expected to boost the performance in various bio application tasks. In particular, BOOTStrep aims at:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> exploiting already existing terminological resources (thesauri, classification systems, etc.) and combining them within a common, standardized conceptual representation framework,. Based on this domain-specific background knowledge advanced natural language technologies are employed for the analysis of biological documents in order to fill conceptual gaps in these resources by automatically acquiring new terms, concepts and relations, </li>
	<li> creating, incrementally maintaining and continuously updating a repository of biological facts based on employing a comprehensive bio-lexicon and a standards-based formal bio-ontology for text analysis. Facts are extracted from biological documents in a fully automatic way, they are subsequently filtered and validated for novelty, redundancy, contradiction, etc., </li>
	 <li> developing resources and resource-building NLP tools for text-based knowledge harvesting in order to support information extraction and text mining in the biology domain, </li>
	 <li> allowing multilingual public access to continuously updated and validated biological fact repositories. </li>
</ul> 
<p>
BOOTStrep has recently launched a collection of automatically generated assertions related to gene regulation processes in E. coli, the BioFactStore. This database integrates information already available from the manually curated <a href="http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/" >RegulonDB</a>, the primary and largest reference database providing manually curated knowledge of the transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli K12.
</p>
<p>
BOOTStrep`s BioFactStore might thus also complement comprehensive biological information centered around E. coli accessible via the <a href="http://www.ecolicommunity.org/">E. coli Hub</a>.

<p>
BOOTStrep (FP6 - 028099) is a Specific Targeted Research Project (STREP) of the European Union’s 6th Framework Programme, Thematic Priority 2 (Information Society Technologies) within the fourth call of the programme. It addresses the strategic objective “Semantic-based Knowledge and Content Systems”.<br>The project started on April 1, 2006 and will end on March 31, 2009. The overall budget is 3.6 million euro. Six partners from four European countries (Germany, U.K., Italy, France) and one Asian partner from Singapore are involved in the project.
