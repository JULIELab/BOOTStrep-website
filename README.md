The orginal BOOTStrep website (formerly availabe at http://bootstrep.eu) was a TWiki that was compromised multiple times.
As maintaining a Wiki for a former project is a unecessary burden,
the important pages were all manually transformed to static pages a few years back.

This is the repo for that reincarnation of the former website.
It should be sufficient to provide all the necessary informations.

In case of a disaster, this is the place to go for recovery.

There is no work in progress.
It's improbable that it'll be converted to a GitHub page / Jekyll.
If anything is defect, it'll probably stay that way -- the project ended a decade ago.
