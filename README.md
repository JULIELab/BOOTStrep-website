The orginal BOOTStrep website was a TWiki that was compromised multiple times.
As maintaining a Wiki for a former project is a unecessary burden,
the important pages were handwritten as static pages a few years back.

This is the repo for that reincarnation of the former website.
It should be sufficient to provide all the necessary informations.

In case of disaster recovery this is the place to go.

There is no work in progress.
It improbable that it will be converted to a GitHub page / Jekyll.
If anything is defect, it probably will stay that way -- the project ended a decade ago!
