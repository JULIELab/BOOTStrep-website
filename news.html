<h3><a id="BOOTStrep_BioNLP_2009_Shared_Ta"></a> BOOTStrep BioNLP 2009 Shared Task - Results (March 2009): </h3>
<p>
The FSU Jena Team participated in the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task on Event Extraction and was ranked 2nd place among 24 participants with an overall average F-score of 46.7 (<a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/SharedTask/results/results-master.html">http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/SharedTask/results/results-master.html</a>).

<h3><a id="BOOTStrep_Final_Workshop_&quot;Semant"></a> BOOTStrep Final Workshop "Semantic Enrichment of the Scientific Literature 2009 (SESL 2009)" </h3>
<p>
Date: 30th-31th of March 2009<br>
Place: Wellcome Trust Conference Center, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK
</p>
<p>
Over the last 10 years, innovation has changed the ways in which scientific publications are gathered and delivered to the public. Since the start of the electronic era:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> publishers have moved from paper presentation of their content to electronic delivery;</li>
	<li> the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) has opened up its archives and delivered Medline abstracts to the public in electronic form;</li>
	<li> open access publishers have been making their content freely available;</li>
	<li> curation teams are increasingly working with the publishers to gather ever more data and provide it to the public and</li>
	<li> proposals have been made that authors should contribute more details to their manuscript (FEBS letter experiment).</li>
</ul> 
<p>
These changes require novel ways to capture and deliver the content to the public and to exchange the content and the annotations between different sites. This has led to increased activities to capture more information from the authors, to align it with the bioinformatics data resources, to deliver the content as part of the scientific literature and to improve the interoperability between existing automatic systems for text processing and exploitation.
This workshop will focus on semantic enrichment of the scientific literature. To this end, workshop participants will have the opportunity to hear about and discuss solutions that capture information from the authors directly and that deliver documents with their annotations. Furthermore, we will discuss the needs of different user groups for the benefits from the scientific literature of the future, e.g. librarians, researchers, automatic text processing and data mining research community, ontologists, others.

<p>
<a href="http://www.u-compare.org">U-Compare</a> is an integrated text mining/natural language processing system based on the UIMA Framework,
which provides access to a large collection of ready-to-use interoperable natural language processing components.

<h3><a id="Announcing_the_BOOTStrep_Mid-Ter"></a> Announcing the BOOTStrep Mid-Term-Workshop "Bridging Ontologies and Text Mining (BOTM)" </h3>
<p>
Date: 12th-13th of September 2007<br/>
Place: EBI, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK
</p>
<p>
Medicine and molecular biology are nowadays data driven sciences, where electronic access to information resources and to analytical tools for electronic data is crucial for the success of ongoing research. Increasingly different parts of the research community are collaborating to generate common benefits. This is the case for the domains of ontological research, bioinformatics databases and text mining. This workshop offers an opportunity to discuss research questions arising from all three domains. Relevant input will be provided from members of the EU research project “BOOTStrep”.
</p>
<p>
BOOTStrep (Bootstrapping Of Ontologies and Terminologies STrategic REsearch Project) is funded in the EC´s 6th Framework Programme. The project started in April 2006 and has generated several resources that will be presented and discussed as part of the workshop: a lexical resource (“BioLexicon”), an ontology on gene regulation (“GRO”), and a UIMA based software package combining a number of text mining solutions. A fact database will be developed in the course of the 2007.
</p>
<p>
The workshop targets members of the research community in bioinformatics, medical informatics, ontological research, computational linguistics and computer science to discuss interoperability across domains. We will investigate on the expectations towards the different resources and their limitations from the perspective of all mentioned domains.
</p>
<p>
Every session will start with a presentation given by a member of the BOOTStrep project covering the topic of the session (30 min). Thereafter the keynote speaker presents ongoing research work in the field (45 min). The final discussion will give enough opportunity to exchange views on selected questions (60 min).<br>
This workshop is unusual in the sense that it will be inspired by ongoing research work in a collaborative European project. The goal is to explore relevant research topics on the basis of experienced researchers confronted with the results from an ambitious project.
</p>
<p>
It is organised in co-operation between the EBI and the BOOTStrep consortium consisting of 7 partners from 5 countries, supported by the European Commission's 6th Framework.
The workshop will be hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in Hinxton, Cambridge, UK. The Auditorium and accomodation are on site at the Genome Campus. London Stansted Airport is at near distance.

<h3><a id="Workshop_on_Text_Mining,_Ontolog"></a> Workshop on Text Mining, Ontologies and NLP in Biomedicine in Manchester (20-21/03/2006) </h3>
<p>
Several distinct but closely related technological fields such as Natural language Processing and Text Mining, Intelligent Information Retrieval, Ontology Engineering and Knowledge Management, Knowledge Discovery, etc. have shown remarkable progress in recent years, which will bring revolution into the ways of conducting science. In particular, due to its rapid expansion and development as well as its data/knowledge intensive nature, life science and biomedical fields have been and will be at the centre of such methodological revolution. We invited researchers in Information Technology who had been successfully applying their research results to life science and those in biomedical fields who have been developing new Information-based approaches in biomedical fields. We are pleased to say that the aim of the workshop, i.e. bringing together researchers from different areas allowing exchange of ideas was successfully achieved and that we enjoyed alive and constructive discussion at the workshop.<br>For additional information visit <a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/jw-tmnlpo/">http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/jw-tmnlpo/</a>.
